# Photo Galli

AI-powered image generator with user authentication, rate limiting, and a retro-themed interface. Users can generate images from text prompts using Hugging Face models (via Netlify Functions) or Puter.ai as a fallback.

---

## Features

- **Image generation**: Text-to-image via Hugging Face (FLUX, SDXL, Stable Diffusion) or Puter.ai
- **Authentication**: User and admin roles, guest mode, sign up, OTP-based password reset via EmailJS
- **Rate limiting**: Per-user generation limits (guest: 2, free: 6, configurable for paid plans)
- **Gallery**: Save generated images, view in Photos page, download, delete
- **Prompt history**: Sidebar with searchable history, click to reuse prompts
- **Admin panel**: User management, rate limit adjustment, prompt/gallery inspection
- **Theme**: Dark/light mode with localStorage persistence
- **Responsive layout**: Mobile-friendly navbar, collapsible sidebar

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (for Netlify CLI, optional)
- Netlify account (for deployment)
- Hugging Face account (for HF_TOKEN)
- EmailJS account (for OTP password reset)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AI_Image_Generator
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder with any static server (e.g. Live Server, `python -m http.server`).

3. For full image generation locally (Hugging Face), use Netlify Dev:
   ```
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   netlify dev
   ```
   Then open the URL shown (e.g. http://localhost:8888).

---

## Environment Variables

Configure these in the Netlify dashboard (Site settings > Environment variables):

| Variable | Description                   | Required                |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| HF_TOKEN | Hugging Face API token (read) | Yes (for HF generation) |

EmailJS credentials are in `auth-const.js` (service ID, template ID, public key). For production, consider moving these to environment variables.

---

## Deployment (Netlify)

1. Connect the repository to Netlify.
2. Build settings: leave build command empty; publish directory: `.` (or project root).
3. Add `HF_TOKEN` in Environment variables.
4. Deploy.

Netlify auto-detects `netlify/functions/` for serverless functions.

---

## Default Credentials

| Role  | Username | Password |
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| Admin | admin    | admin123 |
| User  | demo     | demo123  |

---

## Local vs Production Behavior

- **On Netlify**: Image generation uses the Netlify function, which calls Hugging Face with `HF_TOKEN`. If that fails, Puter.ai is used as fallback.
- **On localhost**: The app skips the Netlify function (it returns 405) and uses Puter.ai directly. To test Hugging Face locally, run `netlify dev`.

---

## Modular Design

- **CSS**: `style.css` imports 26 modular files (vars, base, navbar, layout, sidebar, cards, forms, buttons, etc.). Each file has a short comment describing its scope.
- **JavaScript**: Auth logic is split into 10 modules (`auth-const`, `auth-session`, `auth-guest`, etc.); app logic into 3 (`app-dom`, `app-main`, `app`). Load order is defined in each HTML page.
